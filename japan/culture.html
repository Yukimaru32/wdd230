                <h2>Food Culture</h2>
                <p>Japanese food has has a long history when talking about its various styles in food. Surrounded by seas, we have developed our own food culture related to 
                    seafood and innovated original recipe which was originally from different countries. There are also some misconceptions that people might have in different countries. 
                    Understanding these would help you to see what the real Japanese food culture is !

                <h2>Ramen: Big Change from Orignal</h2>
                <p>One striking example of Japans innovative food culture is ramen. Although it originated in China as a simple dish with a single flavor, 
                    when it made its way to Japan, local chefs transformed it into a culinary art form by experimenting with diverse broths such as miso, dashi, salt, 
                    tonkotsu, and even oyster. By combining different seasonings in varying ratios, they unlocked an almost infinite array of flavor possibilities, giving 
                    rise to over two hundred unique ramen styles across Japan. Even if I haven't had the chance to try them all, I find the evolution of ramen to be a fascinating 
                    reflection of Japanese creativity and passion for food.

                <h2>Tempura: Not invented in Japan?</h2>
                <p>
                    Tempura is celebrated as one of the iconic dishes of Japanese cuisine, yet many are unaware of its foreign roots. 
                    Originating from Portugal, tempura was introduced to Japan in the 16th century during the period of active trade,
                     which notably included the exchange of firearms. Once in Japan, the dish was embraced and transformed as local chefs began using 
                     indigenous vegetables and fish to craft a lighter, crispier version that has become synonymous with modern Japanese tempura. 
                     This evolution highlights the adaptive nature of Japanese cuisine and its ability to weave diverse culinary traditions into a uniquely 
                     refined food culture.

                <h2>Misconception: Teriyaki is NOT popular?</h2>
                <p>Although teriyaki flavor is widely celebrated around the world, it is not as prevalent in Japan as many might think. 
                    International audiences often associate Japanese cuisine with the sweet and savory notes of teriyaki, yet within Japan, 
                    traditional flavors such as umami-rich dashi or subtly seasoned soy-based sauces are more common. This contrast highlights 
                    the dynamic nature of Japanese culinary traditions, where local preferences differ significantly from the tastes popularized abroad. 
                    The teriyaki taste, while iconic globally, serves as an interesting example of how perceptions of a cuisine can evolve outside its country of 
                    origin.</p>
